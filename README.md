repecwomen.parquet is a subset of repectwitter.parquet and one could assume that this subset are female economists, however, the remaining individuals repectwitter.parquet may not all be male economists. twitterdata.parquet is too large to include in the repo (about 500mb) and is therefore included as a dropbox link. It contains the up to last 2000 tweets of all economists in the repectwitter.parquet in July 2022.

 Feel free to use the data.Feel free to contact me on mail@hhsievertsen.net if you have questions.
